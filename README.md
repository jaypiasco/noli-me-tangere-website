# noli-me-tangere-website
a website I built in 2019 for a school project.

#you may watch the teaser of these website in this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGjb0IrxwiU 

The codebase still has a lot to improve, including its design, functionalities, and overall experience.

I originally made this program in a smaller resolution, thus the user interface really only works at 150% zoom (1980x1080p) may vary in different resolutions.

(I got a suggestion to publicize my website for easy URL access, still need to rewrite unmaintained codes to keep the code functional :)
